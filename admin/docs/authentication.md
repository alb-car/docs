# Platform Authentication and Access Control

The DigitalHub Platform supports authentication with an external provider.

It is mandatory to set custom values for the platform, so [Helm](https://helm.sh/) knowledge is required.

This section will show how to set an authentication for the following:

- [Coder](authentication/coder.md)
- [Core](authentication/core.md)
- [Dashboard](authentication/dashboard.md)
- [Kubernetes Resource Manager](authentication/krm.md)
- [Kubeflow](authentication/kubeflow.md)
- [Minio](authentication/minio.md)
