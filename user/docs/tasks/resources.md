# Resource Management with KRM

Different platform entities are associated with and represented as Kubernetes resources: they are deployed as services, user volumes and secrets, captured as Custom Resources, etc. Kubernetes Resource Manager (KRM) component allows for performing various operations over these resources depending on their kind.

![KRM image](../images/krm/krm.png)

KRM navigation menu provides access to different types of resources. This includes both standard resources (Services, Deployments, Persistent Volume Claims, Secrets) and custom resources based on Custom Resource Definitions currently installed on the platform. Some custom resources are managed with the customized UI
(e.g., PostgreSQL instances, PostgREST Data services o Dremio Data service), while the others may be managed with the standard UI based on their JSON schema.

## Management of Standard Kubernetes Resources

KRM allows for accessing and managing the standard K8S resources relevant for the DigitalHub platform: space (through Persistent Volume Claims), services and deployments, and secrets.

### Listing K8S Services

Accessing the `Services` menu of the KRM, it is possible to list the (subset of) services deployed on Kubernetes relevant to DigitalHub.

![KRM Services image](../images/krm/krm_services.png)

For each service KRM shows its name, type (e.g., Coder workspace type), exposed port type and value. In the service details view it is possible to access other metadata, such as labels, creation timestamps. version, etc.

### Listing K8S Deployments

Accessing the `Deployments` menu of the KRM, it is possible to list the (subset of) deployments on Kubernetes relevant to DigitalHub.

![KRM Deployments image](../images/krm/krm_deployments.png)

For each deployment KRM shows its name and availability of instances. In the deployment details view it is possible to access other metadata, such as labels, creation timestamps. version, etc.

### Managing Persistent Volume Claims

In certain cases, the operations developed with the platform may require more substantial disk space, e.g., for training / producing significant amounts of data. In this case, it is possible to attach to the tasks the corresponding Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) references. To create a new PVC for the use of the pipeline or Job, KRM provides the corresponding interface.

Accessing `Persistent Volume Claims` menu, it is possible to list and manage the PVCs of the platform.

![KRM PVCs image](../images/krm/krm_pvcs.png)

For each PVC, you can see the status (Pending or Bound) of the PVC, the name of the volume (if specified), the storage class and the size in *Gi*. The details view provides further metadata regarding the PVC.

It is also possible to delete the PVC and create new ones.

!!! warning "Deleting PVC"

    Please note that deleting a PVC bound to a Pod or a Job may affect negatively their execution.

To create a new PVC, provide the following:

- *Name*: Name of the resource
- *Space*: Disk space request
- *Storage class name*: Storage class name (select one of the available in your deployment)
- *Volume*: Name of the volume (**Important!** Can be specified only if a volume already exists, otherwise, the PVC cannot be bound.)
- *Access modes*: Access modes (standard K8S values)
- *Mode*: PVC mode (Filesystem or Block)

### Listing K8S Secrets

Accessing the `Secrets` menu of the KRM, it is possible to list the (subset of) secrets on Kubernetes relevant to DigitalHub.

![KRM Secrets image](../images/krm/krm_secrets.png)

For each secret KRM shows its name, type, and number of elements. In the secret details view it is possible to access other metadata and also a list of secret elements. The values are not available directly; to retrieve the actual value of the secret element, use `Decode` button that will copy the decoded content of the secret into Clipboard.

![KRM Secret image](../images/krm/krm_secret.png)


## Managing Custom Resources

KRM allows for the management of generic CRs as well as for the management of some predefined ones, such as PostgreSQL instances, PostgREST and Dremio Data services.

### Managing PostgreSQL instances with KRM

Using PostgreSQL operator (https://github.com/movetokube/postgres-operator) it is possible to create new DB instances and the DB users to organize the data storage.

Accessing `Postgres DBs` menu of the KRM, it is possible to list, create, and delete PostgreSQL databases.

![KRM Postgres image](../images/krm/krm_postgres.png)

To create a new Database, provide the following:

- name of the database to create
- whether to drop the DB on resource deletion
- Comma-separated list of PostgreSQL extensions to enable (e.g., timescale and/or postgis) as supported by the platform deployment (optional).
- Comma-separated list of schemas to create in DB (optional)
- Name of the master role for the DB access management (optional)

![KRM Postgres create image](../images/krm/krm_postgres_create.png)

In the Database details view it is possible also to configure the DB users that can access and operate the Database (create, edit, view, delete). To create a new user, it is necessary to specify:

- name of the associated resource
- name of the user to be created
- access privileges (e.g., Owner, Read, or Write)
- name of the secret to be create to store the user credentials and DB access information. This results in creating a secret  `<user-cr-name>-<secret-name>` that can be accessed in the Secrets section of KRM.

![KRM Postgres user create image](../images/krm/krm_postgres_user_create.png)

### Managing S3 resources with KRM

If supported by the deployment, using Minio S3 operator (http://github.com/scc-digitalhub/minio-operator/) it is possible to create new S3 buckets, policies, and create/associate users to them.

Accessing `S3 Buckets` menu of the KRM, it is possible to list, create, and delete S3 buckets, policies, and users.

![KRM S3 buckets image](../images/krm/krm_s3.png)

To create a new Bucket, provide the following:

- name of the bucket to create
- optional quota for the bucket

![KRM S3 bucket create image](../images/krm/krm_s3_bucket_create.png)

In the S3 Policies tab view it is possible also to configure the S3 policies. To create a new policy, it is necessary to specify:

- name of the associated resource
- name of the policy to be created
- standard S3 policy spec in JSON format.

![KRM S3 policy create image](../images/krm/krm_s3_policy_create.png)

In the S3 Users tab view it is possible also to configure the S3 users. To create a new user, it is necessary to specify:

- name of the associated resource
- access key for the user to be created
- secret key for the user
- list of policies to associate to the user.

![KRM S3 policy create image](../images/krm/krm_s3_user_create.png)

### Managing PostgREST Data Services with KRM

You can deploy new PostgREST data services through KRM. A PostgREST service exposes a set of PostgreSQL tables through a REST API, allowing to query and even modify them.

Access `PostgREST Data Services` on the left menu.

![KRM PostgREST image](../images/krm/krm_postgrest.png)

When creating a new PostgREST service, fields are as follows:

- Name of the resource
- Schema to expose
- Existing DB user (role) on behalf of which the service will operate **OR** the list of actions to enable and the list of tables which will be exposed and on which these actions may be performed. The user will be created automatically for this second option.
- Connection information.
    - If you choose not to provide an existing secret, **Host**, **Database**, **User** and **Password** are required.
    - If you decide to use a secret, you must provide the **secret's name**. Two possible configurations are valid:
        - If the secret contains `POSTGRES_URL` (the full connection string, as `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`), all other connection fields will be ignored.
        - If the secret contains `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`, **Host** and **Database** must be provided, or the resource will enter an error state.

Port is optional and defaults to `5432` if not provided.

Extra connection parameters may be provided in the format `param1=value1&param2=value2`. For example, to disable SSL: `sslmode=disable`.

!!! warning "Connection information"

    Please note that when no existing DB user is specified, the user specified in the *Connection* section must have sufficient privileges to manage roles. By default, the owner/writer/reader users created by the Postgres operator do not have this permission.

!!! warning "Schema exposure"
    PostgREST exposes all tables and views in the specified schema. In order to have better control over the exposed data, it is
    recommended to create a separate schema (e.g., `api`) and provide access to data through views or stored procedures. You can use **SQLPad** to do this.


![KRM PostgREST create image](../images/krm/krm_postgrest_create.png)

Check out [the official documentation](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/) for more information on PostgREST.

### Managing Dremio Data Services with KRM

You can deploy new Dremio data services through KRM. A Dremio data service exposes Dremio data through a REST API.

Access `Dremio Data Services` on the left menu.

![KRM Dremio image](../images/krm/krm_dremio.png)

To create a new service, provide the following:

- Name of the resource
- List of virtual datasets to expose
- Connection information.
    - **Host** is required.
    - *Port* is optional and will default to `32010` if not provided.
    - **User** and **Password** are required, unless you choose to use a secret, in which case the **secret's name** must be provided. The secret should contain `USER` and `PASSWORD`.
    - *Extra connection parameters* are optional and may be provided in the format `param1=value1&param2=value2`. For example, to disable certificate verification: `useEncryption=false&disableCertificateVerification=true`.

If you instantiated Dremio through Coder, the value of **Host** is the value of *Arrow Flight Endpoint*, stripped of `:` and port. **User** is `admin` and **Password** is the value you entered when creating the workspace.

![KRM Dremio create image](../images/krm/krm_dremio_create.png)

A Dremio REST service will be deployed, connected to the specified Dremio instance and exposing a simple REST API over the listed datasets.

### Exposing services externally

Various APIs and services (e.g., PostgREST or Dremio data services, serverless functions) may be exposed externally, outside of the platform, on a public domain of the platform. Using KRM, the operation amounts to defining a new API gateway resource that will be transformed into the corresponding ingress routing specification.

![KRM API gateway create image](../images/krm/krm_apigw.png)

To create a new API gateway, provide the following:

- **Name** of the gateway. This is merely an identifier for Kubernetes.
- Kubernetes **service** to be exposed (select it from the dropdown list and **port** will automatically be provided).
- **Host** defines the full domain name under which the service will be exposed. By default, it refers to the `services` subdomain. If your instance of the platform is found in the `example.com` domain, this field's value could be `myservice.services.example.com`.
- Relative **path** to expose the service on.
- **Authentication** information. Currently, services may be unprotected (``None``) or protected with ``Basic`` authentication, specifying username and password.

## Defining and Managing CRD Schemas

To have a valid representation of the CRs in the system, it is necessary to have a JSON specification schema for each CRDs. Normally, such schema is
provided with the CRD definition and is used by KRM to manage the resources. However, in certain cases a CRD may have no structured schema definition attached.
To allow for managing such resources, it is possible to provide a custom schema for the CRD.

Creating a schema is fairly simple. Access the **Settings** section from the left menu and click *Create*.

The **CRD** drop-down menu will list all *Custom Resource Definitions* available on the Kubernetes instance; when you pick one, the **Version** field will automatically be filled with the version of the currently active schema.

Provide the **Schema** definition and save it in KRM for future CR management.
