# ETL scenario introduction

Here we explore a simple yet realistic scenario. We collect some data regarding traffic, analyze and transform it, then expose the resulting dataset.

Access Jupyter from your Coder instance and create a new notebook. If a Jupyter workspace isn't already available, create one from its template.

Copy the snippets of code from here and paste them in your notebook, then execute them with *Shift+Enter*. After running, Jupyter will create a new code cell. Alternatively, the final notebook for this scenario can be found in the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/scc-digitalhub/digitalhub-tutorials/tree/main/s1-etl).

## Set-up

First, we initialize our environment and create a project.

Import required libraries:

```python
import digitalhub as dh
import pandas as pd
import requests
import os
```

Create a project:

```python
PROJECT = "demo-etl"
project = dh.get_or_create_project(PROJECT)
```

Check that the project has been created successfully:

```python
print(project)
```

## Peek at the data

Let's take a look at the data we will work with, which is available in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format at a remote API.

Set the URL to the data and the file name:

```python
URL = "https://opendata.comune.bologna.it/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/rilevazione-flusso-veicoli-tramite-spire-anno-2023/exports/csv?lang=it&timezone=Europe%2FRome&use_labels=true&delimiter=%3B"
filename = "rilevazione-flusso-veicoli-tramite-spire-anno-2023.csv"
```

Download the file and save it locally:

```python
with requests.get(URL) as r:
    with open(filename, "wb") as f:
        f.write(r.content)
```

Use *pandas* to read the file into a dataframe:

```python
df = pd.read_csv(filename, sep=";")
```

You can now run `df.head()` to view the first few records of the dataset. They contain information about how many vehicles have passed a sensor (spire), located at specific coordinates, within different time slots. If you wish, use `df.dtypes` to list the columns and respective types of the data, or `df.size` to know the data's size in Bytes.

In the next section, we will collect this data and save it to the object store.
